# Review Assessment - Mongoose

We're doing this primarily to help us understand how well you've absorbed.  Don't stress out that we will be using this test to judge you in any way except to understand how we can better help you.

Also, we ask that you don't help each other or cheat.  Feel free to use any online resource but don't copy/paste answers to each other or if you find something similar online.

## Resources

The following resources are allowed:

* Online documentation and articles.
* Any notes you've taken so far.
* learn.fullstackacademy.com.
* All the slide decks that we've used in class.

The following resources are *not* allowed:

* The solutions repo
* Review videos
* Your own solution code from prior workshops

## Things we're testing

* Mongoose Model Configuration

## Starting

1. Read through the project models folder. You will be writing code in `task.model.js`.
2. Execute the tests with `npm test`. There is no auto-runner (yet) for this assessment.
2. Start working through the tests in `test/`. You have to mark them as active (from pending) by changing `xit` to `it`.

### Note

* You will not need to `require` anything. All necessary modules are already loaded in the correct place; the model can be completed by writing inside the existing function blocks.
* The `helper` module is being used by the test spec. You should read it to better understand the tests, but it is not needed to implement the solution.
