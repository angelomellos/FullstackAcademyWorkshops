# Review Week Mini-Assessment 1

## Data Structures

### Fork the Repo

Navigate to [this repo](https://github.com/FullstackAcademy/mini-assessment-data) and fork it to your own Github account. Then `git clone` your forked repo to your local machine.

### Running the Specs

The Test'Em Jasmine spec runner must be installed on your system

```
npm install -g testem
```

Execute the tests by running `testem` from the assessment folder.

### Test Parameters

You may work on the suites in any order, except that to do `Hash` you need a working `LinkedList.addToTail`.

You can pass the `Queue` & `Stack` specs using simple array methods to begin. If you finish `LinkedList` & `Hash`, attempt `Queue` & `Stack` solutions that use pointers (indices).

Submit what you can finish in 90 minutes.

### Submitting your Code

Zip your project directory and email it to the Fullstack instructors at instructors+assessment@fullstackacademy.com.
